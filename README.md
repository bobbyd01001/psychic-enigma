# psychic-enigma

this is a python3 gui application built using guizero and other geolocation modules. 
make sure you install all the modules used to create and run application. this is a basic build to create a map from public ip to destinaiton ip. Eventually I would like to build in the ability to quickly create a traceroute map. 
you also will need to aquire a mapquest API key as wel as an API key from MaxMind. 
please feel free to contribute and make this tool better.
